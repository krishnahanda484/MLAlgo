# **Machine Learning Algorithms Repository**

This repository is a complete collection of **machine learning algorithms**, covering everything from **supervised** to **unsupervised** learning.  

The goal is to build a clear, well-structured, and hands-on implementation base for understanding and applying ML algorithms — from the fundamentals to advanced concepts.
